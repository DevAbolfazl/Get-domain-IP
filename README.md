# Get-domain-IP
 
A light and fast program to find the IP of the domain that Source Tak created. This program is applicable in php version 5.6 and above. It can even be used on local hosts, but you must be connected to the Internet.
In fact, the basis of finding IP is using this function:
```php
gethostbyname($domain);
```
This program is only a user interface. It is recommended not to use it on the host because hackers may infiltrate the site through it.
Safe version will be released soon.
